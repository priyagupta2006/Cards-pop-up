# 🃏 Card Pop-Up

A creative HTML & CSS mini project where multiple image cards overlap slightly, and clicking on any card brings it to the front with a smooth layered effect.

## 🌟 Features

- Interactive card layout
- Click to bring card to front
- Smooth visual layering using `z-index`
- CSS-only solution — no JavaScript
- Responsive design with well-fitted images

- 
## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
  - `:hover` and active styles
  - `z-index` for layer control
  - `border`, `overflow`, `object-fit`
  - `position: absolute` for layout

## 🎯 How It Works

- Cards are placed on screen using absolute positioning.
- On hover or click, the selected card gets a higher `z-index` and appears on top.
- Neat visual stacking for UI experiments and games.
